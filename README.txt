This project is not an application proper; it rather provides additional (shared)
base libraries for multiple other projects. The Ant build script produces ten
JAR files in the "dist" folder, namely:

- GamtaFeedbackAPI.jar: Utilities and widgets for getting input from users, both
                        in a desktop environment with a Swing UI and via web based
                        forms

- GamtaImagingAPI.jar: Utilities and widgets for analyzing (scanned) text images

- AbbreviationUtils.jar: Utilities for resolving abbreviations in documents

- BibRefUtils.jar: Utilities and widgets for working with bibliographic reference
                   data

- DateTimeUtils.jar: Utilities for parsing and normalizing dates and times

- GeoUtils.jar: Utilities for working with geo-coordinates

- MaterialsCitationUtils.jar: Utilities for working with materials citations in
                              taxonomic documents

- QuantityUtils.jar: Utilities for working with quantities

- TableUtils.jar: Utilities for and widgets for working with tables

- TaxonomicNameUtils.jar: Utilities and widgets for working with taxonomic names


All ten JAR files generated by Ant include both the Java sources and the class files,
as well as other resources required for the code to work.


This project depends on the following external JAR files to build (all included in the
"lib" folder for convenience):
- servlet-api.jar
- icepdf-core.jar (by IceSoft, http://www.icesoft.org/java/projects/ICEpdf/overview.jsf,
                  used under the terms of the Mozilla Public License)

In addition, it requires the JAR files build by the Ant script in the idaho-core
project (http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/) and the JAR files referenced from
there. See http://code.google.com/p/idaho-core/source/browse/README.txt for the
latter. You can either check out idaho-core as a project into the same workspace
and build it first, or include the JAR files it generates in the "lib" folder.
